I am fullstack software developer who enjoys collaboration, problem solving and learning new technologies. After spending a few years in software technical support, I decided to pursue my passion in software development and attend Fullstack Academy.

I first was introduced to programming while at college where I learned computer science fundementals and enjoyed solving algorithm and logic problems. I am interested in continuing to learn new technology and frameworks and use this knowledge to contribute to a meaningful team.
