My first exposure to programming was my freshman year of college. I rememeber that we started learning with paper and pen or pencil. We where given specific tasks like looping over an array or summing up numbers in an array. Then increasingly building on that knowlege and applying it ‘larger’ programs.I really enjoyed programming from the start. It gave me control of how I approached a problem or how clean it could be written.

However, I was also interested in Economics. Something with those demand and supply graphs made sence to me. It was a very ‘dry’ subject as well; something like white or black or true or false. I particularly enjoyed learning about the different policies as well like Monetary policy. And how they contribute to decisions made at a higher institution like the Federal Reserve. I eventually majored in econs and choose to minor in computer science.

What I remember from my last year in school was that those computer science classes would take more time because I was not studying CS fulltime. I would finish any work related to econs and all my leftover time was dedicated to CS and mostly working out bugs in my code because by this time my CS classes where significantly higher level. An example of a project we did was a shoping cart. Given a .txt file we parse the file and eventually create all the componenets simulating a shopping cart.

Once graduated, I started working for a chemical company. I did sales for a year and eventually got the opportunity to move to a field engineer position. The position entailed working on large frame computers that where attached to a 3D printer. It was a unique job which involved alot of troubleshooting and working alot with hardware and very hands on. I enjoyed the work but I missed learning to code and coding.

I took a leap and went to work at a tech company doing tech support. It was a very complex software to say the least. My job was to reproduce bugs in the software and either solve them or move them to the engineering or dev group. Not very much coding went on but I did use sql to retrieve information from the back end. After a year on the job, I needed to make a decision either to go back to school for a CS degree or considere a bootcamp. I decided to take a night class on Javascript for a month that was provided by [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/).

At this time, I was leaning more to attending a bootcamp. The class started with very simple concepts like variable and loops. And the instructor was really knowledgeable and wanted us to do well and learn the material. The lecture was very relavant to the exercises and you really learn the material.

I apologize for making this post too long. I promise, I’m almost done. Fast forwarding two month after taking the class I applied to [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) and got in!

### I am now starting the junior phase and will keep posting my journey. Cheers!
