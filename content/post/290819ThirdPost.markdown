For my third post I will briefly go through the curriculm I went over during my time at Fullstack Academy. To be accepted I had to go through
 through a skype interview which involved pair programming with a profesor or a fellow where you work through a problem together and they assess you or provide some guidance to complete the challenge. In my experience, completing the javascript night class for a month provided me the foundation to pass the interview and start the program. The night class is great. You go through functions, loops, recurcion and much more. At the end there is an optional Soduku project your are able to complete which helps prepare you for the intrance assessment and just provides you with a good foundation. Here is a link to mine if your curious [Sodoku](https://repl.it/@DanielCasasola/GlumSharpQueries).

The Stack tought through the first six weeks of the program is React, Redux, HTML and CSS on the frontend runnning along side a Node.js server using Express and Sequelize as an ORM. There is also error handling and express middleware. Here is a
[graph](https://fullstackacademy.github.io/stack-map/) of the technology working together.

After the first six weeks of doing pair programming and working solo projects you start putting together fullstack apps. The first is the senior enrichment which is a solo project done in less than a week but incorporates the whole stack. There is also an e-commerce web app which you, along with three others teamates, come up with the idea of what to sell and create an online commerce store.

The final project was the most fun. Along with three other team members, you come up with an app idea. Ours was an app to   plan an event. You can choose new technology to work with like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) which is a popular one. We also incorporated [GoogleCalendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) APIs to help bring together what our app needed to do.

Overall, it was a great experience and you learn ALOT to say the least. The above is just a glimpse of the projects we did while completing the program. Of course, the learning never stops and there is always new things to learn. Most students, if not all students, land a job as software engineers. In my case it took three months after completing the program and I am currently working with a PHP, MySQL and Javascript stack.

### Cheers!
