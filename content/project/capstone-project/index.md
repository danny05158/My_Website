The Feast React web app was created to help plan, organize and invite guests
to your dinner party. We utilized the NodeMailer API to send email invites to
guests. We also integrated maps using the Mapbox API for users to know the location
of the event. Team collaboration thruough Github and we incorporated
Agile workflow.
